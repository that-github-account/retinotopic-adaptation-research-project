Retinotopic Adaptation to the Perception of Causality - Project Code

This repository contains the code used for my 3rd year dissertation project on the adaptation to causality. All code is written in python but needs to be run in the processing (https://www.processing.org/) IDE. The version of processing that this project was run in is 4.0b8.
